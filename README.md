# Speech_to_text
A simple tool to convert audio recordings into text using the SpeechRecognition library in Python is provided below.
How to Use:
Save the code:
Save the provided Python code as a .py file (e.g., audio_transcriber.py).
Prepare an audio file:
Place a .wav audio file in the same directory as your script, or provide its full path.
Update audio_file variable:
In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, change 'your_audio_file.wav' to the actual name or path of your audio file.
Run the script:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run it using:
Code

    python audio_transcriber.py
The script will then attempt to transcribe the audio file and print the resulting text to the console.
